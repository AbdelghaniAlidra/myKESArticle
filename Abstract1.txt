Abstract:
Todayâ€™s software-intensive systems have to operate in a wide variety of dynamically changing environmental circumstances, leading to continuously changing execution context. Therefore, such systems need to adapt to their environment during execution, and to be reconfigurable for new situations. The most notable existing approaches to adaptation are based on a reconfiguration component having as required input the list of the possible configurations and the rules to switch between them. However, these approaches are ill-suited for modern, complex systems, as they enable a system to self-adapt only against scenarios that were considered at design time. In this paper, we present a new multi objectives genetic algorithm for variants generation in the context of runtime adaptation. Moreover, we present a so called transitive selection operator to fasten the process of decision making. We report numerical results showing that our approach presents better performance in terms of computation over head while maintaining a good quality of the generated solutions. We also specify a real word case study to demonstrate the suitability of our proposal.
