Why is self/auto (adaptation/reconfiguration)/runtime (variability/evolution) /autonmous/pervasive (computing/system) is important?
Because of the continusly ""changing environment""

What are the mains challenges?
The main challenge is planning/decision-making because it is critical and time cunsumming

How have been them addressed so long?
using rules of objective functions.

What are the limitations?
existing approaches scale bad to large systems (in time and accuracy/behavior optimality/quality of adaptation/reconfiguration and handling unforseen scenarios/the scoop of adaptability.

What problem(s) is addressed in this article?
produces good solutions in reasonable amount time

How is it addressed?
1- We formaly formulated the decision making/planning process based on a variability model.
2- We defined a transitive selection operator
3- We used it in a multiobjectives genetic algorithm.
Why is the proposed solution better than previous ones?
Our Algo produces solutions of equivalent quality in 50% (in average) of the time of existing GAs.

Can you prove it?
1- The computation complexity of our transitive operator is O(N/M) whereas of fmTransoform is N.
2- We report experimental results performed on 10 different size feature models
3- We applied our proposal to the smarthome example.
