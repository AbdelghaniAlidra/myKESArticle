Todayâ€™s software-intensive systems have to operate in a wide variety of dynamically changing environmental circumstances, leading to continuously changing execution context. Therefore, such systems need to adapt to their environment during execution, and to be reconfigurable for new situations. The most notable existing approaches to adaptation are based on a reconfiguration component having as required input the list of the possible configurations and the rules to switch between them. However, these approaches are ill-suited for modern, complex systems, as they enable a system to self-adapt only against scenarios that were considered at design time. In this paper, we present an approach that uses the feature model concept and a genetic algorithm- based decision-making for system adaptation. Our approach presents better performance and flexibility. and allows to re-exploit the variability knowledge constructed at design time.
